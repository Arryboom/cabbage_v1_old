== Cabbage Widgets

Cabbage widgets can loosly be split into two groups, interactive widgets and non-interactive widgets. Each interactive widget, such as a slider, a button, etc., will be accessible in a plugin host. The non-interactive widgets, such as group boxes and images, can only be controlled manually, or via Csound. The name that appears beside each native slider in the plugin host will be the assigned channel name for that widget. 

Each Cabbage widget has a corresponding set of identifiers that can be set to control its appearance and behaviour. Not all widgets support the same identifiers however. For example, a groupbox will never need to have a channel assigned to it because it`s a static control. Likewise buttons don`t need to use the range() identifier. Parameters within quotation marks represent string values, while those without represent floating point decimals, or integer values. Below is a detailed overview of each widget available in Cabbage, and the corresponding identifiers that can be used with it.

bounds() must be set for every widget. All other identifiers will be given default values if none are set.  

== Form
[source]
----
form caption("title"), size(Width, Height), pluginid("plug"), colour("colour"), guifresh(val)
----

Form creates the main application window. pluginid() is the only required identifier. The default values for size are 600x300. 

---
=== Identifiers
`caption` The string passed to caption will be the string that appears on the main application window. 

`size(Width, Height)` integer values denoted the width and height of the form.

`pluginid("plug")` this unique string must be four characters long. It is the ID given to your plugin when loaded by plugin hosts. 

`guirefresh(val)` Sets the rate at which Cabbage will update its GUI widgets when controlled by Csound. The value passed represents the number of k-rate cycles to be skipped before the next update. The larger this is the slower the GUI updates will take place, but the less CPU intensive the instrument will be. val should be an integer greater than 1 and is set to 50 by default. 

`colour("colour")` This sets the background colour of the instrument. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create blue. RGBA values are not permitted when setting colours for your main form. If an RGBA value is set, Cabbage will convert it to RGB.  

[icon="images/smallLogo.PNG"]
NOTE: Every plugin must have a unique plugin ID. If you experience problems loading two different plugins, it could be because they use the same plugin ID. The plugin ID seems to be more relevant when working with OSX than on Linux or Windows.

== Group Box
[source]
groupbox bounds(x, y, width, height), text("Caption"), colour("colour"), fontcolour("colour"), line(value), plant("name"), popup(val), child(val), visible(val), alpha(val), show(val), identchannel("channel")


Groupbox creates a container for other GUI widgets. They do not communicate with Csound but can be useful for organising widgets into panels.

---
=== Identifiers
`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels)

`text("caption")` "caption" will be the string to appear on the group box

`colour("colour")` This sets the colour of the groupbox. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`fontcolour("colour")` Sets the colour of the font to appear on the groupbox. See above for details on valid colours. .

`line(value)` Turns off the line that appears on a groupbox. 

`plant("name")` Sets the name of the plant. No two plants can have the same name. See link#_plants[Plants]

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default. 

`popup(val)` If the groupbox is a plant, a value of 1 will cause the groupbox to open in a new window when show(1) is called. popup() should always be used in conjunction with the show() identifier. See WORKING_WITH_PLANTS

`show(val)` A value of 1 will cause the popup plant to show. A value of 0 will close the popup plant. See WORKING_WITH_PLANTS

`child(0)` A value of 1 will cause the popup plant to be a child of the main form. By default, popup plants are not children of the main form and can therefore appear anywhere on screen. If the popup plant is a child of the main form, it can only appear within the bounds of the main form. 

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. See IDENTIFIER_CHANNELS

== Keyboard
[source]
----
keyboard bounds(x, y, width, height), value(note), identchannel("channel"), visible(val)
----

Keyboard will display a keyboard that will send MIDI information to your Csound instrument. This component can be used together with a hardware controller. Pressing keys on the actual MIDI keyboard will cause the on-screen keys to react up. 

---
=== Identifiers
`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels)

`value(note)` sets the note on the leftmost side of the keyboard when it appears on-screen. Middle C, 60, is the default. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default. 

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. See IDENTIFIER_CHANNELS

[icon="images/smallLogo.PNG"]
NOTE: The keyboard can be played at different velocities depending on where you click on the key with your mouse. Clicking at the top of the key will cause a quieter velocity while clicking on the bottom will cause the note to sound with full velocity. If you wish to play the keyboard like a nutjob in standalone mode, make sure to pass '-m0d' to the CsOptions(disable console messages). The keyboard widget is only provided as a quick and easy means of testing plugins in Cabbage. Treating it as anything more than that could result in severe disappointment!

[source]
----
image bounds(x, y, width, height), colour("colour"), file("file name"), shape("type"), outline("colour"), line(thickness), `plant("name"), identchannel("channel"), visible(val), alpha(val)
----

Image creates a static shape or graphic. It can be used to show pictures or it can be used to draw simple shapes. If you wish to display a picture you must pass the file name to the file() identifier. For convenience, the file passed to file() should be in the same directory as your Cabbage instrument. 

---
=== Identifiers 

`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels). 

`file("filename")` "filename" is the name of the image file to be displayed on the widget. This file must reside in the same directory as the current .csd file. Do not pass a full path. Cabbage only needs the name and extension, for example file("cabbage.PNG").

----

---
=== Identifiers

Button creates a button on screen that can be used for a whole range of different tasks. The "channel" string identifies the channel on which the host will communicate with an instance of Csound. "OnCaption" and "OffCaption" determine the strings that will appear on the button as users toggle between two states, i.e., 0 or 1. By default these captions are set to "On" and "Off" but the user can specify any strings they wish. 

`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels). 

`channel("chan")` "chan" is the name of the channel that Cabbage will communicate with Csound on. The current value of this widget can be retrieved in Csound using a chnget opcode, or can be set using a chnset opcode. 

`text("offCaption", "onCaption")` The text identifier must be passed at least one string argument. This string will be the one that will appear on the button. If you pass two strings to text() the button will toggle between the two string each time it is pushed.  

`value(val)` val sets the initial state of the widget

`colour:0("colour")` This sets the colour of the button when it's value is 0. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`colour:1("colour")` This sets the colour of the button when it's value is 1.  See above for details on valid colours. 

`fontcolour:0("colour")` Sets the colour of the text that appears on the button when it's in its off state. See above for details on valid colours. 

`fontcolour:1("colour")` Sets the colour of the text that appears on the button when it's in its on state. See above for details on valid colours. 

`latched(val)` With latched set to 0 the button will send a message to Csound on the initial mouse press, and once again as soon as the user releases the button. Therefore the button will toggle between 0 and 1 on each click rather than needing two separate mouse clicks. 

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. 

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default. 

`caption("caption")` This identifier will place the widget within a groupbox. "caption" is the text that will appear on group box. This identifier is included for legacy purposes only. It is recommended that you use use your own groupbox component as it will give you far more control over how everything appears on your instrument. 

[icon="images/smallLogo.PNG"]
NOTE: colour:1() and fontcolour:1() can be set using colour() and fontcolour(). However, it's recommended that you use the numerated colour identifiers in order to make your code as readable a possible.

`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels)

`text("name")` "name" will be the text that appears on the top of the info button.  

`colour("colour")` This sets the colour of the button. filebuttons only have a single state, therefore they don't need a unique on and off colour. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`fontcolour("colour")` Sets the colour of the text that appears with the slider. See above for details on valid colours.

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. See IDENTIFIER_CHANNELS

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default. 

`populate("filetype", "dir")` Sets the type of file to search for, and the initial directory to look in. For example, to set the file type to wave files use "*.wav" as the filetype string. If using the filebutton to record parameter snapshots, you must specify a filetype of "*.snaps". If no directory is specified, the file browser will open in the current working directory.

textcolour("colour"), fontcolour("colour"), trackercolour("colour"), outlinecolour("colour"), identchannel("channel"), alpha(val), visible(val), caption("caption")
----

Slider can be used to create an on-screen slider. Data can be sent to Csound on the channel specified through the chan string. Presented above is the syntax for a horizontal slider, i.e., hslider. In order to change it to another slider type simple substitute hslider with the appropriate slider type as outlined below. 

---
=== Identifiers
`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels). 

`channel("chan")` "chan" is the name of the channel that Cabbage will communicate with Csound on. The current value of this widget can be retrieved in Csound using a chnget opcode, or can be set using a chnset opcode. If you are using a hslider2 or vslider2 widget you will need to pass two channel names, e.g., channel("sliderMin", "slidermax"), as the slider will be sending data over two channels. 

`range(min, max, value, skew, incr)` the first 2 parameters are required. The rest are optional. The first two parameters let you set the minimum value and the maximum value. The next parameter determines the initial value of the slider. The next allows you to adjust the skew factor. Tweaking the skew factor can cause the slider to output values in a non linear fashion. A skew of 0.5 will cause the slider to output values in an exponential fashion. A skew of 1 is the default value, which causes the slider to behave is a typical linear form. 

`min(val)` If using a double or triple pointer slider (hslider2, hslider3, vslider2, vslider3), min() will set the default minimum position of the minimum thumb controller. The absolute minimum is set using the range identifier. See above.

`max(val)` If using a double or triple pointer slider (hslider2, hslider3, vslider2, vslider3), max() will set the default maximum position of the maximum thumb controller. The absolute maximum is set using the range identifier. See above. 

`text("name")` The string passed in for "name" will appear on a label beside the slider. This is useful for naming sliders.   

`textbox(on/off)` textbox takes a 0 or a 1. 1 will cause a text box to appear with the sliders values. Leaving this out will result in the numbers appearing automatically when you hover over the sliders with your mouse.

`colour("colour")` This sets the slider. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`textcolour("colour")` This set the colour of the text passed to text(). If you wish to change the colour of the numbers being displayed use fontcolour(). See below. See above for details on valid colours. 

`fontcolour("colour")` Sets the colour of the text used to display the slider's value when textbox is enable. See above for details on valid colours. .

`trackercolour("colour")` Sets the colour of the slider`s tracker. This is the line that follows the slider when you move it. See above for details on valid colours. 

`outlinecolour("colour")` Sets the colour of a rotary slider`s tracker outline. This is the line that is drawn around the rslider's tracker. If you don't wish to display the tracker outline set the colour to something with an alpha value of 0. See above for details on valid colours.  

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. 

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default. 

`caption("caption")` This identifier will place the widget within a groupbox. "caption" is the text that will appear on group box. This identifier is included for legacy purposes only. It is recommended that you use use your own groupbox component as it will give you far more control over how everything appears on your instrument. 

Slider types::

* *rslider*, a standard rotary or knob slider

* *hslider*, a standard horizontal slider

* *vslider*, a standard vertical slider

* *hslider2*, two value horizontal range slider

* *vslider2*, two value vertical range slider

* *hslider3*, horizontal slider with adjustable min and max limits

* *vslider3*, vertical slider with adjustable min and max limits.  

[icon="images/smallLogo.PNG"]
NOTE: Make sure to use two unique channel names when using hslider2 and vslider2, otherwise min and max will be set to the same value.

-------

---
=== Identifiers
Combobox creates a drop-down list of items which users can choose from. Once the user selects an item, the index of their selection will be sent to Csound on a channel named by the channel string. The default value is 0.

`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels).

`channel("chan")` "chan" is the name of the channel that Cabbage will communicate with Csound on. The current value of this widget can be retrieved in Csound using a chnget opcode, or can be set using a chnset opcode. 

`items("item1", "item2", ...)` list of items that will populate the combo box. Each item has a corresponding index value. The first item when selected will send a 1, the second item a 2, the third a 3 etc. If this identifier is left out default values of "Item 1", "Item  2", "Item  3", "Item 4" and "Item 5" will be used.  

`value(val)` val sets the initial state of the widget
  
`populate("filetype", "dir")` This will auto-populate the combobox with a set of files from a given directory. Users should specify the file type and the directory to look in. If using a combobox to recall previously recorded preset snapshots you must specify a filetype of "*.snaps". When using populate you don`t need to use items() to populate the combobox. If no directory is specified, Cabbage will look in the current working directory.  
  
`caption("caption")` This identifier lets you place your widget within a groupbox. "caption" is the text that will appear on groupbox. This identifier is useful for naming and containing widgets.  

`channeltype("type")` Specifies the type of channel. Default is "float". If you wish to send the text contained in the combobox, for examples the names of a set of audio samples, set type to "string". If type is not set to string the index of the selected item will be sent to Csound on the named channel. 

`colour("colour")` This sets the background colour of the combobox. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`fontcolour("colour")` Sets the colour of the text and arrow that appear on the combobox. See above for details on valid colours.

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. 

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default.

`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels)

`colour("colour")` This sets the colour of the image if a file name is not passed to file. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`fontcolour("colour")` Sets the colour of the text that appears with the slider. See above for details on valid colours. .

`file("file name")` Set the file that will be opened. This file must reside in the same directory as the current .csd file. Do not pass a full path. Cabbage only needs the name and extension, for example file("help.txt"). 

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. 

`wrap(val)` Turns text wrapping on of off. This is set to 0 by default, so no wrapping of text is done. 

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default.

----------------------------
xypad bounds(x, y, width, height), channel("chan1", "chan2"), rangex(min, max, val), rangey(min, max, val), text("name"), identchannel("channel"), colour("colour"), fontcolour("colour"), alpha(val), visible(val)
----------------------------

xypad is an x/y controller that sends data to Csound on two named channels. The first channel transmits the current position of the ball on the X axis, while the second transmits the position of the ball on the Y axis. The XY pad can function in two unique modes of automation, free and path based. The two modes can be toggled by clicking on the corresponding icon on the bottom left of the xypad control. With either mode selected you can right-click the xypad and create a trajectory or path for the circle's movement. Release the mouse and the circle will start moving. Once the ball is in full flight you can control the speed of the ball using the XY pad slider that will appear once you hover over it with the mouse. To stop the ball simple left click anywhere on the xy pad canvas with the left mouse button.

`bounds(x, y, width, height)` integer values that set position and size on screen(in pixels)

`channel("chan1", "chan2")` "chan1" is the name of the X-axis channel in which to communicate with Csound, and "chan2" is the Y-axis channel in which to communicate with Csound.

`text("name")` "name" will be the text that appears on the top right hand side of the XYpad surface.  

`rangex(min, max, value)` sets the range of the X axis. The first 2 parameters are required. The third is optional. The first two parameters let you set the minimum value and the maximum value. The next parameter determines the initial value. 

`rangey(min, max, value)` sets the range of the Y axis. The first 2 parameters are required. The third is optional. The first two parameters let you set the minimum value and the maximum value. The next parameter determines the initial value. 

`colour("colour")` This sets the colour of the xypad circle and corresponding number boxes. Any CSS or HTML colour string can be passed to this identifier. The colour identifier can also be passed an RBG, or RGBA value. All channel values must be between 0 and 255. For instance colour(0, 0, 255) will create a blue, while colour(0, 255, 0, 255) will create a green with an alpha channel set to full.  

`fontcolour("colour")` This sets the colour of the xypad text label and mode selector labels. See above for details on valid colours.

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. 

`alpha(val)` A value between 0 and 1 will set the alpha blend value for the entire component. Can be useful if you need to fade widgets in and out. 

`visible(val)` A value of 0 will cause the widget to become invisible. Widgets have their visibility set to 1 by default

NOTE: XY pads range identifiers do not permit the setting of skew factors, or increments. If you wish to set a custom skew factor, or increment value, you will need to do so using Csound code.

== Table
----------------------------
table bounds(x, y, width, height), channel("chan1", "chan2", ...), tableNumbers(1, 2, ...), colour("colour1", "colour2", ...), 
			drawMode(m1, m2, ...), amprange(min, max), resizeMode(val), readonly(val), identchannel("channel")
----------------------------

table is a new and experimental control which creates a function table editor capable of displaying any number of tables at once. If multiple tables are specified the tables will be superimposed on top of each other. To edit a table one must right click the table and select `edit`. You mst choose the number of points that will be used to represent the table. Note that this leads to some decimation or tables (If you wish to create a high resolution table just use a Csound GEN routine).

`channel("chan1",  ...)` specifies the channel with which to communicate with Csound on. As table is not an interactive control it only retrieves data from Csound. A value of -1 will causes Cabbage to update the corresponding table, while a value between 0 and 1 will cause a scrubber to appear on the table, 0 being the start of the table, 1 being the end. 

`amprange(min, max)` sets the global amplitude range(Y-axis). Min and Max are the minimum and maximum values. Omitting this identifiers will cause the table widgets to rescale the Y-axis if users increase the max amp value. 

`drawMode(m1, m2, ...)` sets the drawing mode for the tables, where m1, m2, m3, etc, are integers denoting the particular drawing mode to be used in the table see below. 

`resizemode(val)` If this is set to 1 the table will resize if a users drags a point above the maximum amplitude value. val should be 0 or 1

`tableNumbers(1, 2, ..)` sets the table to be displayed. 

`readonly(val)` This identifier removes edit-mode from a table. By default tables can be put into edit mode with a right-click. With readonly set to 1 tables can no longer be editing on the fly however, users can still interact with a table if its draw mode is set to five. val should be 0 or 1. 

`colour("colour1", "colour2", ...)` sets the colours of the tables. Note that you must pass valid CSS colour names and NOT RGB colours to this list.  

`identchannel("channel")` Sets the channel which messages from Csound are sent to the widget on. When used with a chnset opcode users can override widget attributes. 

Drawing Modes:

`0` Normal drawing mode. Joins each successive point in the table with a straight line. No fill. Users must right click to enable edit mode in the table.
`1` Same as above, but horizontal lines are drawn between points resulting in a bar-graph type of representation. 
`2` Same as mode 0 only the envelope will used fixed points. This means users will not be able to move any points on the envelope left or right. They are restricted to up/down movement only. 
`3` Same as above but with horizontal lines between the fixed points.  
`4` This mode results in a fixed point table with horizontal lines that is in edit mode from the onset. This mode also has toggle min/max enabled meaning users can click on a point to toggle it between min and max values. This drawing mode is useful for pattern editors.

== Plants

Cabbage plants are GUI abstractions that contain one or more controls. These abstractions are used as anchors to the child widgets contained within. All widgets contained within a plant have top and left positions which are relative the the top left position of the parent. While all widgets can be children of a plant, only group boxes and images can be used as plants themselves. Adding a plant identifier to an image or group box definition will cause them to act as containers. The plant() identifier takes a string that denotes the name of the plant. Plant names must be unique within an instrument or plants will end up being placed on top of each other. When using an image or a group box as a plant, you must enclose the code from the controls that follow in curly brackets, to indicate which controls belong to the plant. In the code below a group box control is set up as a plant, and three child sliders are placed within it.

---------------
groupbox bounds(12, 115, 170, 100), text("Output Filter -k-rate-"), plant("filter"){ 
rslider bounds(.01, .3, .6, .6), text("Freq"), channel("filtFreq"), range(0, 22050, 10000)
rslider bounds(.32, .3, .6, .6), text("Res"), channel("filtRes"), range(0, 1, 0)
rslider bounds(.64, .3, .6, .6), text("Dist"), channel("filtDist"), range(0, 4, 0)
}
---------------

image:images/plant.PNG[xypad]

The values passed to bounds() for the child controls can be either fractions proportional to the plants overall size and position, or absolute pixel values. For example, `bounds(0, .5, .5, 1)` will cause a child widget to appear half way across the plant, and half way down. While `bounds(10, 10, 200, 200)` will cause the child control to be 10 pixels from the top/left, and have a size of 200x200 pixels.   

The major advantage to using plant abstractions is that you can easily move and resize them without needing to modify the dimensions of the child components contained within. You can also save your plants and recall them later from a plant repository. Plants are intended to be reused across instruments so users don`t have to keep rebuilding GUIs from scratch. They can also be used to give your plugins a unique look and feel. 

== Reserved Channels
-----------------
Cabbage reserves several channels which are used to send information to Csound from either the host application, or from Cabbage itself. To retrieve info from any of these channels just use a chnget opcode.

`CSD_PATH` This string channel will retrieve the full path to the current csd file.

`HOST_BPM` Retrieve the currents host bpm. This will be updated whenever the host BPM changes.

`IS_PLAYING` Pressing play on the host transport dialogue will cause this channel to send a 1. Hitting stop will send a 0.

`IS_RECORDING` As above only for monitoring the record status of a session.

`TIME_IN_SECONDS` Return the current time in seconds from the start of the track.

`TIME_IN_SAMPLES` Return the current time in samples from the start of the track.

`TIME_SIG_DENOM` The signature denominator, e.g. the 4 of a 3/4 time sig 

`TIME_SIG_NUM` The signature numerator, e.g. the 3 of a 3/4 time sig 

`HOST_PPQ_POS` Return the position of the start of the last bar, in pulses-per-quarter-note.

`MOUSE_X` Returns the X coordinate of the current mouse position.

`MOUSE_Y` Returns the Y coordinate of the current mouse position

`MOUSE_DOWN_LEFT` Returns the current state of the left most mouse button; 1 if pressed, and 0 if not. 

`MOUSE_DOWN_MIDDLE` Returns the current state of the middle mouse button; 1 if pressed, and 0 if not. 

`MOUSE_DOWN_RIGHT` Returns the current state of the right mouse button; 1 if pressed, and 0 if not.
