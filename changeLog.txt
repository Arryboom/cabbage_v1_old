v0.5.0

- Majority of the source code has been rewritten. On the surface things will still run as usual, but underneath it all things are running much smoother.

- Code editor has received some attention, now features popup opcode hints.
- Csound console is now in a separate window from the editor.

       - all colour attributes of widgets can be modified
       - widgets can be grouped together into plants, and un-grouped at any time

- Cabbage now comes bundled with Csound on Windows.
- Updated build projects for Windows, Linux and OSX.   

Older features brought in from previous code base:
- Added support for building MIDI plugins. See arpeggiator instrument in the examples. 
- Added a populate identifier for use with Comboboxes. Users can now populate a combo box with a series of file from disk. (A current limitation is that this only populates at run time)
- Users can now edit GUIs using the mouse. 
- Added option for users to save their custom plants by right-clicking them in GUI edit mode, plants can be inserted through the context-menu
- Clicking on a GUI control will highlight the corresponding text in the editor
- Added an 'Audio Enabled' menu command to Host
- Added new XYPad, improvements over the last one include:
	- 2 modes of automation, free, and path-based
	- Automation continues to work if the plugin window is closed
	- Various aspects of the XYPad can have their colours customised.  
- Users can now update GUIs without recompiling Csound
- New Editor menu hotkeys: 
	Ctrl+u: updates an instrument's GUI, but will not recompile your .csd file
	Ctrl++: Increase font size
	Ctrl+-: Decrease font size 
- Added Host menu hotkeys:
	Ctrl+b: manually update instrument(if working with external editor)
	Ctrl+o: open an instrument
	Ctrl+u: updates an instrument's GUI, but will not recompile your .csd file
	Ctrl+m: toggle audio
- 'Always on Top' state is now saved to preferences and remembered across sessions
- Added new colour scheme to Editor
- Added a table widget. This is a viewer for function tables. Channels messages get send from Csound to Cabbage to trigger the updating of the tables. Users can also superimpose one table on top of another and use its alpha blend identifier to change the table transparency. While interaction with the tables is not yet possible it is however possible to modify the tables in real time using Csound. See the example .csds for more information 
- Added a new feature to the editor so users can now select a colour for different colour identifiers using a GUI colour selector
- Added an 'auto-update' feature so that Cabbage will automatically update if the current file has been saved remotely
- Added standlone feature, tested mostly on Windows

- fixed a bug in preset mode that showing up in instruments with only one widget 
- fixed problem with presets overriding initialisation values
- changed look and feel for tabbed component
- fixed working directory issue; the directory in which the current .csd file is in is now the current working directory. Any files that Csound writes, which don't have an absolute paths, will be saved to that directory. 
- fixed initialisation for sliders
- fixed problem with snapshots not being taking when using Csound to control widgets
- fixed tracker fill issue, a 0 was not turning the fill off, it will now 
- added old plant coordinate system back to the mix. Both systems can be used now. Coordinates less that
  1 will be proportional values, anything above 1 will be absolute values
